# Research

Our overarching goal is to better understand how the tumor microenvironment, composed of immune, stromal, and tumor cells, contributes to therapy resistance in gastrointestinal cancers. To do so, we use surgically resected specimens and multimodal high-throughput techniques to identify mutational, transcriptomic, and metabolic signatures of disease progression. Then, we evaluate and validate our findings using a gambit of pre-clinical models, including cell, organoid, and mouse models.

Our research team is composed of a leading surgical oncologist, a computational immunologist, and several well-equipped trainees. We work collaboratively with national and international partners who share our goal of improving immunotherapy outcomes for patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.

Here are some themes and approaches that we currently work on:

**Mutational and clonal evoluation of metastatic colorectal cancer.** From a cohort of colorectal cancer patients, we have performed whole-exome sequencing on longitudinally collected microsattelite-stable primary colorectal tumors and paired metastases to evaluate how the mutational landscape progresses in advanced metastatic disease. We pair this with bulk RNA sequencing to better understand how consensus molecular subtypes evolve alongside the mutational spectrum of microsattelite-stable CRC.

**Single cell and spatial profiling of the tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer.** Over 95% of colorectal cancer metastases are microsattelite-stable, and are therefore not approved for immunotherapy. Additionally, response to therapy in various sites of metastases are significantly different, with best responses in the lung and poorest responses in peritoneal metastases. We obtained surgically resected tissue from metastatic colorectal cancer cases to evaluate how the tumor microenvironment differs by location of the metastatic lesion. 

**Patient-derived malignant ascites as a tumorigenic model.** Patients with peritoneal metastases often suffer from fluid build-up in the abdomen, referred to as malignant ascites. To provide temporary relief, ascites may be drained through repeated procedures. However, collected malignant ascites is often discarded as biological waste and rarely leveraged as a biophysiological medium for research. We have identified that malignant ascites recapitulates the tumor microenvironment of peritoneal metastases and can be used as a culture supplement to improve preclinical <i>in vitro</i> models. Our current effort is to better understand the cellular and molecular composition of heterogenous patient-derived malignant ascites to determine the key contributors to disease progression.

**Intracellular metabolism and metabolic drivers of gastrointestinal metastases.** Tumor cell metabolic activity is a key component of disease progression and therapy response in gastrointestinal malignancies. However, little is known about metabolic dependencies that develop in the complex tumor microenvironment of gastrointestinal metastases. We seek to better understand how tumor, immune, and stromal cell metabolism affect immune infiltration and how metabolic dependencies can be used as therapeutic vulnerabilities.


<!-- **Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB. -->
